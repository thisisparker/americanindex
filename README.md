# @pomological

This is the code that runs @pomological, called as a cronjob every 3 hours or so. It's a simple Python script that uploads an image and posts a description to Twitter. The file locations and descriptions, in the .csv here, are scraped variously from the USDA's National Agricultural Library's [online home for the Pomological Watercolor Collection](http://usdawatercolors.nal.usda.gov/pom/home.xhtml) and the [Wikimedia Commons category containing all the images](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:USDA_Pomological_Watercolors).
