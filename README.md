# Index of American Design bot

This repository will be for the code that powers a Twitter bot that iterates through the Index of American Design collection. It's forked from the [@pomological](https://github.com/thisisparker/pombot) repo, which was one of the very first things I ever wrote, so I'm excited to apply a few years of learning to a similar problem.
